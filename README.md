# Library Project

### Things I've used

- Utilised materialise for quick and easy styling.
- Constructor functions to build the objects(books).
- Rendering Arrays to the DOM.
- Utilising ES6 i.e. Arrow functions, forEach.
- Rendering the latest item rather than the whole array.

###Â Things to add:

- Firebase to hold the data.
- Form validation.
- Option to upload an image file instead of using a link.
- Accessibility on the form elements.
